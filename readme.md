# Homogenization.jl

This package provides some tools to do large-scale homogenization of elliptic PDEs in 2D and
3D.

Features include:
1. Support for very fine grids for finite elements without storing the grid / matrix 
   explicitly.
2. A geometric multigrid solver
3. An algorithm to approximate the homogenized coefficients of an elliptic operator with 
   piece-wise continuous coefficients

## Getting started

A recommended way to work with the package now is to clone the package via the package 
manager in a development mode.

1. Open Julia 1.0 in a terminal
2. Hit `]` to open the package manager
3. Enter `dev https://github.com/haampie/Homogenization.jl` or `dev git@github.com:haampie/Homogenization.jl.git`

This will copy the latest version of the code to `~/.julia/dev/Homogenization.jl`.

To verify things work, run the tests via `] test Homogenization`.

### Workflow tips

**Editor.** An editor tailored for Julia is [Juno](http://junolab.org/). Also 
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with a [Julia extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=julialang.language-julia) is good.

**Development.** It is very convenient to install `Revise.jl` to get a better development 
and testing experience in Julia. This package will do the minimal recompilation when a 
function in the package is changed. 

1. Install it via `] add Revise`.
2. Then in a standard Julia terminal run `using Revise`
3. Only then write `using Homogenization`.

**Threading.** To make use of threading and some more optimized code, one can start Julia
in the terminal as follows:

```
JULIA_NUM_THREADS=N julia -O3
```

here `N` is the number of threads avaiable -- it is best to set it to the number of cores
on the machine.

## Visualization

The package uses WriteVTK.jl to output visualizations that can be viewed in [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/).

## Example usage

To run the 2D or 3D checkerboard example, try

```julia
using Homogenization

# 2D
ahom_for_checkercube(64 + 2 * 10, Tri{Float64}; boundary_layer = 10, refinements = 3, tol = 1e-4, k_max = 5, smoothing_steps = 2)

# 3D
ahom_for_checkercube(32 + 2 * 10, Tet{Float64}; boundary_layer = 10, refinements = 2, tol = 1e-4, k_max = 5, smoothing_steps = 2)
```
